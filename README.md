# ES5 example of drag and drop between multiple lists via react-dnd

The ES7 example at https://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/examples-sortable-simple.html
is all very well and good, but falls short if:

 * Your project is in ES5
 * You're still on react 0.13
 * You want an example of drag & dropping elements between different containers.

Hopefully this example addresses the above.  It serves as a test jig for adding
sortable room lists to https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk.
